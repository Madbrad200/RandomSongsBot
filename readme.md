# What is RandomSongsBot?

RandomSongsBot is a discord text bot that will search through Spotify's wide and diverse library to bring you new music!

I randomly grab songs from Spotify - a fun tool to discover music.

# What features does RandomSongsBot have?

RandomSongsBot is able to filter almost 6000 Spotify genres, for example:

`@RandomSongsBot#3234 randommusic -genre chanson`
Or:
`/randommusic find genre:chanson`

This will search through Spotify for a random song matching the `chanson` music genre. You can also a `year` tag:

`@RandomSongsBot#3234 randommusic -genre grime -year 2015`
Or:
`/randommusic find genre:grime year:2015`

This will grab a random song of the `grime` music genre from the year `2015`. You can also enter year ranges, e.g `1995-1999`. There is also the ability to filter for specific artists or albums.

# How does RandomSongsBot search Spotify?

I grab a random character, enter it into Spotify's search, then grab a random song from the list of results.
